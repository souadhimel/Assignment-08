### Road map:

<ul>
<li>orange</li>
<li>red</li>
<li>blue</li>
</ul>

1. I have created JSON data(stored in 'Public' ) as of myself for this project. On the go through of my journey, I used plain CSS as well as Bootstrap. I also extended my dependencies for the smooth go of this project.
2. I used 5 components(Header, Members, Member, Cart,Show) with yarn installation.
3. I had to go for FontAwesomeIcon for making some icons on the go of this project.
